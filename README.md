# Break20
Stare 20 meters away every 20 minutes for 20 seconds

## How it will look if you install this

## TODOs

* Make it even fancier by implementing the letter rain using OpenGL
* Create a more robust installer; it currently assumes you are on Linux and that if it finds Python3 it will be a version that works
* Make the installer is idempotent. I.e., nothing good will come from currently running it multiple times
